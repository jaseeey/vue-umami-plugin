# Vue Umami Plugin

The Vue Umami Plugin integrates Umami analytics by loading the library and injecting it into your application's DOM, allowing you to easily track page views and events.

## Background and Scope

This library was created to reduce duplication and streamline the integration of Umami analytics into a number of my personal Vue projects. Though, I decided to share it with the community in the hope that others may find it useful for similar purposes, either as-is, or as a starting point.

Given its focused nature, the plugin has limitations and may lack functionality available through the official Umami library API.

## Features

- **Automatic Page Tracking:** Automatically track page views through your Vue router.
- **Event Tracking:** Easily track custom events with minimal configuration.
- **Lazy Loading:** The Umami script is loaded only when the document is ready, ensuring minimal impact on performance.
- **Queue System:** Events are queued until the Umami script is loaded, ensuring no events are lost.

## Requirements

- Vue 3.x
- Vue Router (optional, for automatic page tracking)

## Installation

To install and use this plugin, you can include the library via npm:

```bash
npm install @jaseeey/vue-umami-plugin
```

## Usage

To use the Vue Umami Plugin in your project, import it and use it within your Vue application setup:

```javascript
import { createApp } from 'vue';
import { VueUmamiPlugin } from '@jaseeey/vue-umami-plugin';
import App from './App.vue';
import router from './router';

const app = createApp(App);

app.use(VueUmamiPlugin, {
    websiteID: 'YOUR_UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID',
    scriptSrc: 'https://us.umami.is/script.js', // Optional
    router
});

app.use(router).mount('#app');
```

### Tracking Events

To track custom events:

```javascript
import { trackUmamiEvent } from 'vue-umami-plugin';

trackUmamiEvent('button-click', { buttonName: 'subscribe' });
```
